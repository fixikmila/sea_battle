You need to install irrklang to your default library path or you can just copy file file libIrrKlang.so from irrklang/bin/linux-gcc-64(sudo cp irrklang/bin/linux-gcc-64/libIrrKlang.so /your/library/path).

Then you need to go to the folder cmake-build-debug and run binary file client(./client).

In the game you can find the instruction how to play.

Enjoy!
